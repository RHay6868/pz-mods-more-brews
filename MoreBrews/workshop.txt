description=I have been diligently putting this together to share one of my personal hobbies with the PZ community. I did my best to capture the process of brewing beer from start to finish.

description=[h1]What else happened:[/h1]
description=This was designed as a branch build so you can choose between only beer or only wine or select to have both. They function together or accommodate being on their own. Tested to function with version 41.73 and also still works with 41.71 to accommodate MP servers.

description=[h1]Is it safe to add / remove?[/h1]
description=Previous carboys will have disappeared due to item change to fix the fermentation process. Was tested with an old save, in 41.71 and within 41.73. Otherwise no original items were edited, should be able to add or remove this mod at any time. Safe to say you will lose any items you gained from this mod if you remove it. [b][i]NOTE: This has not been thoroughly tested against other mods or in MP[/i][/b]

description=[h1]Where do I find supplies[/h1]
description=Brewing/Wine Kits will be found mostly in Gigamarts but rarely in garages. A few supplies will be found in tool shops (Bottle Capper + Can Sealer). Beer and wine bottles will be in bars and in a minimal amount of fridges. The remaining supplies will need to be crafted or obtained through kits.
description=
description=[h1]Additional Information[/h1]
description=Most likely will be adding in a distilling process for spirits. Then adding in cocktails to work nicely with future updates. Growable plants are not in the near future, I need to have a better grasp of the code surrounding farming as it impacts gameplay and I would hate to break a save/server.
